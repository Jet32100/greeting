#Create a simple greeting app that you can interact with through your terminal.
	# A user will enter their name and see a greeting returned that uses the name they entered



############# STEP ONE: Accept user input ######################
#Print Instructions to Terminal that instruct the user(person running the program) to enter their name


#Accept user input using the gets method
	#Store that user input in a variable
	# .chomp the user input so that it doesn't have a trailing line break
	#the method returns a string that looks something like this:  “Top of the Morning to you James!”






########## STEP TWO: Define your method #########################

#Create a new method ( with a semantic name )
	#While defining the method, set a parameter so that it will accept an argument when we later call the method
	#Create a greeting and interpolate or concatenate the name parameter
	#Remember to end your method!





###### STEP THREE: Call your method ##########
	#Call the method you just created above
	#be sure to pass a name arguement
	#The argument you pass should be the variable you set with the user input
